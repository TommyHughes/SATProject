Overview---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAT test score information by district was obtained and cleaned for the years 2012-2017. 
Due to inconsistency in data acquisition, only the years 2014-2017 were used.

Median household income by district was obtained and cleaned and joined to SAT to performance
data.

Logistic regression was used to categorize Economically Disadvantaged students and Not
Economically Disadvantaged students by average (by district) Math scores. The machine learning regression 
accurately predicted economic status 70% of the time.

Linear regression was used to clarify the relationship between as well as predict average Math scores
based on median household income for the county.

Graphs of the distributions of average math scores by economic category were generated by year. 
A boxplot, grouped by economic category and faceted by year, were generated to examine
the math score distributions as well.
